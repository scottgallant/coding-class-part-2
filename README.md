Today we covered:

* border radius
* box shadow
* New page (javascript.html)
* Added a button with onclick event that fired an alert


Next class: 
* Make sure we link to javascript.html from all pages (and remove SVGs from javascript.html since it's messing up the code highlighting)
* Let's break out the Script tag to it's own file (like we did with style.css)
* Go over functions.  What are they "a chunk of code to do a task". What is the syntax. 
* Click button => alert "warning"
* Explain variables. A var is a box. It just contains things. It can hold a number. Some text. And other things. 
* var alertText = "Warning! This is Dangerous"
* Click button => alert random num between 0 and 1
* Click button => alert random num between 0 and 20
* Click button => alert random num between 0 and 20 but round down
* Add input for "name" 
* Click button => alert "name is cool"
* Play with Dom object. Append p to DOM
* Discuss methods and properties
* Click button and updated DOM 
* Create Mad Lib
