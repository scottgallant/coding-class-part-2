# We went over the selector slides here 
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Gr00EOagSKOKwpv0v2RqnviE5V54Z8gY4r6fcFnqzSg/edit#slide=id.g1e2d0acca49_0_27

We made a paragraphs and selected it with element, 
did another one and selected it with class,
again but used id
then selected the second paragraph with nth-child

then we talked about inline Vs block (needs more work)
then we added a new pragraph at the begining and added a tags  to show inline


## Next class:
Set up links, separate pages, and stylesheets. 
Inline vs block again. 3 boxes. block, then inline. 
Then talk about padding/margin/w/h/border.
